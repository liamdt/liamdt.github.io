## Gephi

And what a nightmare it was.

I think it would be fair to say that I did not excel at use of this tool. 

As he is far edgier than I, I used the code that Daniel put up on the class page to get the edges to plot. This worked, to a degree.  I was able to plot out the network in Gephi.  Of course, it is an incomprehensible mess.  Beyond opaque.  There's too much going on, all clustered in one spot, and doing nothing for anyone.  Looks silly as heck.

I've included that here!

There was, of course, more fun to be had.  Preview works for me about one in seven times - the rest it is blank, and following forum advice, I had to clear all used data, then go through the rigamarole once more.  That worked a couple time.  Later on resaving and reopening was enough, and now, of course, an angry white void laughs at me.

I don't love this Gephi situation, to be totally honest.

I was also unable to properly merge my coordinates with the network I'd built up - and those attempts I did make resulted in either destroying my edges sheet or trashing Gephi.  I think I need to work this through again.

That said, I do see the value of this as a tool - the results of the Star Wars data are far more legible, and therefore more useful.  That seems like a method of approaching data that truly does open up new avenues for research/understanding - but with a dataset this large it gets messy.  I imagine that the same issue

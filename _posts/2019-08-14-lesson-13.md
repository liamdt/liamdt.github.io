## Gephi

And what a nightmare it was.

I think it would be fair to say that I did not excel at use of this tool. 

As he is far edgier than I, I used the code that Daniel put up on the class page to get the edges to plot. This worked, to a degree.  I was able to plot out the network in Gephi.  Of course, it is an incomprehensible mess.  Beyond opaque.  There's too much going on, all clustered in one spot, and doing nothing for anyone.

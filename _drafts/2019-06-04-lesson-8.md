    #full credit to Herr Bernhard Koschicek. I was not successful without his clearly annotated code.  Effectively, I was misusing "with" and thus scrambling my code like so many eggs.  He and I differed in our apporach - I stacked all of my files in a single folder, he organized via subfolders.  I have to assume his ways is superior, because he is at the very least a minor deity in this course, but it felt disingenuous to completely change my approach after the fact.

    path = "C:/Users/Liam/Documents/School/GradSchool/DHMethods/Lesson08/betterdispatch/"
    target = "C:/Users/Liam/Documents/School/GradSchool/DHMethods/Lesson08/cleanliam/"
    listOfFiles = os.listdir(path)

    metacount = 1

    for f in listOfFiles:
        with open(path+f, "r", encoding="utf8") as f1:
            data = f1.read()

            #establish a counter
            articlenum = 0

            # isolate date
            date = re.search(r'<date value="([\d-]+)"', data).group(1)

            # split text
            splitting = re.split(r"<div3 type=\"article\"", data)

            for i in splitting[1:]:
                # article number from a given issue.  first version of this I reset the counter within this loop. That didn't go well.
                articlenum += 1
                # clean the header
                i = "<div 3 " + i
                # our classic markup removal notes
                text = re.sub("<[^<]+>","", i)
                # fresh file names
                newFile =  target + date + "_" + str(articlenum) + ".xml"
                # write that badboy
                with open(newFile, "w", encoding="utf8") as f9:
                    f9.write(text)

        # keep track of how far you are in through the articles. I should probably not have it print every time.
        print(metacount)
        metacount += 1
